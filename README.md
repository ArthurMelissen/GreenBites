# GreenBites

This is a one-off I made to test an API:

GreenBites is a fictional food company that needs cloud integration.

This is all prototype quality.

This code uses [C++17](https://en.cppreference.com/w/) and [Qt 5.10+](https://www.qt.io/)

# Building

```
apt install g++ qt5-default
qmake
make
```

# Running

```
export JEXIA_PROJECT_URL=
export JEXIA_KEY=
export JEXIA_SECRET=

./generator
```
